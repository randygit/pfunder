        Forgot your password, <%= name %>?
    </p> 
    <p>
        Patak received a request to reset the password for your Patak account (<%= username %>).
        <br />
        <br />
        To reset your password, click on the link below (or copy and paste the URL into your browser):
        <br />
        <br />
        <a href="<%= verifyURL %>"><%= verifyURL %></a>
        <br />
        <br />  
        If you're getting a lot of password reset emails you didn't request, you can change your account settings to require personal information to start a password reset.
        <br />
